DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.

IMPORTANT: This update will require you to clean the whole replays table because the method of storing the data for replays was changed. Proceed with caution.


COPY & RUN THE FOLLOWING QUERIES
--------
alter table users add twofa_secret varchar(16) null after token_code;
alter table sessions_events add has_bounced int null after viewport_height;
alter table visitors_sessions add total_events int default 1 null after website_id;
DELETE FROM `sessions_replays`;
alter table plans change is_enabled status tinyint not null;
UPDATE settings SET value = '{\"plan_id\":\"custom\",\"name\":\"Custom\",\"status\":1}' WHERE `key` = 'plan_custom';
--------
