DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


IMPORTANT: This update will require you to clean the whole replays table because the method of storing the data for replays was remade. Proceed with caution.


COPY & RUN THE FOLLOWING QUERIES
--------
LOCK TABLES sessions_replays WRITE;
DELETE FROM sessions_replays;
alter table sessions_replays add events int null after website_id;
alter table sessions_replays drop column type;
alter table sessions_replays drop column data;
alter table sessions_replays add last_date datetime null;
alter table sessions_replays drop column timestamp;
alter table sessions_replays add constraint sessions_replays_pk unique (session_id);
UNLOCK TABLES;
create index visitors_sessions_date_index on visitors_sessions (date);
alter table websites add excluded_ips text null after path;
