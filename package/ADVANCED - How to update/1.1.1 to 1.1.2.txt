DATABASE CHANGES 
--------------------
IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR DATABASE JUST TO BE SAFE. 

You will have to run the following queries into your database. 

You can run those with PhpMyAdmin -> selecting the database -> going to the SQL tab and running the following mysql query.


COPY & RUN THE FOLLOWING QUERIES
--------
alter table users add country varchar(32) default '' not null;
alter table events_children add expiration_date date null;
alter table sessions_replays add expiration_date date null;
CREATE INDEX expiration_date ON events_children (expiration_date);
CREATE INDEX expiration_date ON sessions_replays (expiration_date);
--------
